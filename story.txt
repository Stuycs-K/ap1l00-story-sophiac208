Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on case, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the beach. It is a way I have of driving off the
car and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the airport;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my bed; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin days, and bringing up the rear of every person I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the trap, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's gardens off—then, I account it high time to get to school as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all the glasses in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the sun with me.
